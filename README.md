🌾 LÚAvia | The Masterpiece Collection

LÚAvia is a premium educational rice-growing kit designed for children. It bridges the gap between traditional Vietnamese wet-rice culture and a modern hands-on journey of nature discovery at home.



✨ Core Concept

LÚAvia is more than just a planting kit; it is a multi-sensory educational experience:

Designed for Ages 6+: Simple enough for children to follow, yet meaningful for the whole family.

Hands-on Agronomy: Children get to touch the soil, plant real seeds, and nurture life directly.

Educational Value: Builds curiosity, responsibility, and environmental awareness.

Cultural Connection: Bringing the spirit of the Mekong Delta countryside into modern urban living spaces.





About Us
LÚAvia was founded by a group of passionate students from the University of Transportation in Ho Chi Minh City (UTH). Our mission is to reconnect the next generation with their cultural roots and the miracles of nature.
